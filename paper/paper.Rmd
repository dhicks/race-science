# Introduction

foo \cite{JacksonScienceSegregationRace2005}


\appendix
# Materials and methods
Appendix figures and tables will also need to be moved. A basic example is provided here so this feature is also tested.

First we have a figure.

```{r thrice, echo=FALSE, fig.cap='test thrice'}
plot(rnorm(10))
```

And next we have a table

\begin{table}[ht]
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ll}
thrice & 1 \\
thrice & 2\\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\end{table}
