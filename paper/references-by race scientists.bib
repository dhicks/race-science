  abstract = {Jackson Jr. and Winston (2021) claim there is no taboo against research on race and intelligence. We argue, to the contrary, that there is a taboo against such research. We begin by addressing Jackson Jr. and Winston's arguments concerning expert surveys, as well as their criticisms of our published database of controversies. We then provide additional evidence of the taboo, and explain why it would be expected given the features of academic social science in Western countries. We also point out that Jackson Jr. and Winston's paper exemplifies the very taboo they claim does not exist.},

  abstract = {In a very short time, it is likely that we will identify many of the genetic variants underlying individual differences in intelligence. We should be prepared for the possibility that these variants are not distributed identically among all geographic populations, and that this explains some of the phenotypic differences in measured intelligence among groups. However, some philosophers and scientists believe that we should refrain from conducting research that might demonstrate the (partly) genetic origin of group differences in IQ. Many scholars view academic interest in this topic as inherently morally suspect or even racist. The majority of philosophers and social scientists take it for granted that all population differences in intelligence are due to environmental factors. The present paper argues that the widespread practice of ignoring or rejecting research on intelligence differences can have unintended negative consequences. Social policies predicated on environmentalist theories of group differences may fail to achieve their aims. Large swaths of academic work in both the humanities and social sciences assume the truth of environmentalism and are vulnerable to being undermined. We have failed to work through the moral implications of group differences to prepare for the possibility that they will be shown to exist.},

Internal consistency reliabilities were relatively high and similar across both Black and White samples, although there was a trend for lower reliabilities in the Black sample. Overall, the Black and White samples were associated with similar Genos EI means and standard deviations. Based on the differential item functioning (DIF) analyses, three of the 70 Genos EI items were found to be biased. However, the magnitude of the bias was considered negligible based on the DIF plots. Results are discussed in light of the small differences between Blacks and Whites on a measure of self-reported EI. It is suggested that some published criteria for evaluating practically significant DIF may be too conservative.},

  abstract = {The purpose of this study is threefold. First, an estimate of state IQ is derived and its strengths and limitations are considered. To that end, an indicator of downward bias in estimating state IQ is provided. Two preliminary causal models are offered that predict state IQ. These models were found to be highly predictive of state IQ, yielding multiple R's of 0.83 and 0.89. Second, the extent to which state IQ predicts state outcome variables (e.g., gross state product, health, violent crime, and government effectiveness) is estimated. State IQ shows positive correlations with gross state product, health, and government effectiveness and negative correlations with violent crime. These results are consistent with the extent to which IQ predicts outcomes at the level of the individual. Third, a research agenda is provided for improving estimates of state IQ, identifying factors that cause differences in state IQ, and delineating the role of IQ in predicting important variables.},

Results from a follow-up convenience survey indicated that, in the aggregate, White participants' rating of White Americans' average IQ and average intelligence is higher than Blacks Americans' average IQ test score and average intelligence and was not driven by White participants' belief in a universal White intellectual superiority.
