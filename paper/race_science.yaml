    Most biological anthropologists acknowledge that phenotypic human variation
    is distinct from human race. However, there is the potential for the
    research on human variation to be (mis)interpreted by the public as a
    reification of biological races. To explore this possible misuse, this study
    is a content analysis of articles (n = 1146) in the prominent race science
    journals Mankind Quarterly; The Journal of Social, Political, and Economic
    Studies; and The Occidental Quarterly. The goal is to investigate how race
    science employs research in biological and forensic anthropology to justify
    arguments. Articles were evaluated according to country affiliation,
    discipline, data sets, racial/ethnic terminology, position on racial
    hierarchy, position on racial segregation and eugenics, focus of study,
    views of scientific community, and the average power index (PI).
    Additionally, specific examples of (mis)appropriation are highlighted.

  abstract: >-
    To serve racially diverse clients effectively, professional psychologists
    should understand the range of scientific and social forces shaping their
    own and their clients' lives. A manifestation of such forces, the 1994
    publication of R. J. Herrnstein and C. Murray's The Bell Curve: Intelligence
    and Class Structure in American Life was an attempt to influence both
    psychological knowledge and U.S. politics. This article analyzes the book
    and 5 psychologist authors' responses to it. The responses fell far short of
    providing a critical analysis of the book's racially biased argument and did
    little to reduce the misleading picture of race and IQ that the book
    promulgated. Scrutinizing the whole book--especially connections among
    scientific knowledge, proposed policy, and professional practice with
    attention to the "code logic" used--will enable practitioners to recognize
    and change subtle aspects of racial dynamics that occur in their work.

    Arthur Jensen was arguably the father of modern academic racism. For over 40
    years, Jensen, an educational psychologist at the University of California,
    Berkeley, provided a patina of academic respectability to pseudoscientific
    theories of black inferiority and segregationist public policies. Jensen was
    responsible for resurrecting the idea that the black population is
    inherently and immutably less intelligent than the white population, an
    ideology that immediately became known as “jensenism.”

  abstract: >-
    This fascinating study in the sociology of knowledge documents the
    refutation of scientific foundations for racism in Britain and the United
    States between the two world wars, when the definition of race as a
    biological concept was replaced by a cultural notion of race. Discussing the
    work of the leading biologists and anthropologists who wrote about race
    between the wars, Dr. Barkan argues that the impetus for the shift in
    ideologies of race came from the inclusion of outsiders--women, Jews, and
    leftists--into the mainstream of scientific discourse.

  abstract: >-
    Previous studies suggest a reduced dopaminergic function in subjects with
    the A1 (minor) allele of the D2 dopamine receptor (DRD2) gene. To explore
    influences on visuospatial ability as a function of the DRD2 gene, 182
    alcohol- and other drug-naive sons (age 10–14) of active alcoholic,
    recovered alcoholic, and nonalcoholic fathers were administered a
    visuospatial task (Benton's Judgment of Line Orientation Test) which makes
    minimal motoric/verbal demands. Visuospatial scores were lower for boys with
    the A1 allele and for sons of active alcoholics. A1-allele boys made more
    errors than A2 boys on all 11 of the template lines, with the effect being
    largest for the rightmost presentations. In contrast, the effect of family
    history for alcoholism was strongest on both right and left midquadrant
    presentations. Moreover, separate analyses of the two types of errors
    produced allele but not family history of alcoholism effects when the two
    lines were misjudged as farther apart than they actually were and family
    history but not allele effects where the two lines were misjudged as closer
    together. These results suggest that polymorphism of the DRD2 gene and
    family history of alcoholism are dissociable determinants of visuospatial
    ability and that visuospatial defects previously observed in alcoholics may,
    in part, be antecedent to their drinking behavior.

  abstract: "We argue for a virtue epistemological approach to the demarcation problem, for we think that\_such an approach makes sense from the perspective of an ameliorative epistemology. We argue that sustained and consistent pseudoscientific beliefs and attitudes call for an explanation in terms of underlying epistemic vices, and that remedying them calls for charging the relevant people with vice, but in a responsible and sensitive way. We exemplify some common epistemic vices associated with pseudoscientific beliefs through the case of Feng Shui. We then discuss the value of incorporating pseudoscience in science education and advocate teaching students to identify epistemic virtues and vices in scientific and pseudoscientific practices. We argue for an education focused on epistemic character building and cultivating epistemically virtuous students from early on. This will lead them to become good epistemic agents, in general, and careful (producers and) consumers of science and pseudoscience in particular."

  abstract: >-
    Objectives Debate about the cause of IQ score gaps between Black and White
    populations has persisted within genetics, anthropology, and psychology.
    Recently, authors claimed polygenic scores provide evidence that a
    significant portion of differences in cognitive performance between Black
    and White populations are caused by genetic differences due to natural
    selection, the “hereditarian hypothesis.” This study aims to show conceptual
    and methodological flaws of past studies supporting the hereditarian
    hypothesis. Materials and methods Polygenic scores for educational
    attainment were constructed for African and European samples of the 1000
    Genomes Project. Evidence for selection was evaluated using an excess
    variance test. Education associated variants were further evaluated for
    signals of selection by testing for excess genetic differentiation (Fst).
    Expected mean difference in IQ for populations was calculated under a
    neutral evolutionary scenario and contrasted to hereditarian claims. Results
    Tests for selection using polygenic scores failed to find evidence of
    natural selection when the less biased within-family GWAS effect sizes were
    used. Tests for selection using Fst values did not find evidence of natural
    selection. Expected mean difference in IQ was substantially smaller than
    postulated by hereditarians, even under unrealistic assumptions that
    overestimate genetic contribution. Conclusion Given these results,
    hereditarian claims are not supported in the least. Cognitive performance
    does not appear to have been under diversifying selection in Europeans and
    Africans. In the absence of diversifying selection, the best case estimate
    for genetic contributions to group differences in cognitive performance is
    substantially smaller than hereditarians claim and is consistent with
    genetic differences contributing little to the Black–White gap.

  abstract: >-
    The first edition of this best-selling book showed that alongside the subtle
    forms of discrimination typical of the post-Civil Rights era, new powerful
    ideology of 'color-blind racism' has emerged. Bonilla-Silva documented how
    beneath the rhetorical maze of contemporary racial discourse lies a
    full-blown arsenal of arguments, phrases, and stories that whites use to
    account for and ultimately justify racial inequities. In the new edition
    Bonilla-Silva has added a chapter dealing with the future of racial
    stratification in America that goes beyond the white / black dichotomy. He
    argues that the U.S. is developing a more complex and apparently 'plural'
    racial order that will mimic Latin American patterns of racial
    stratification. Another new chapter addresses a variety of questions from
    readers of the first edition. And he has updated the book throughout with
    new information, data, and references where appropriate. The book ends with
    a new Postscript, 'What is to be Done (For Real?)'. As in the highly
    acclaimed first edition, Bonilla-Silva continues to challenge color-blind
    thinking.

  abstract: >-
    It has become increasingly popular to theorize and assert significant
    genetic differences between arbitrary regional, ethnic, and racial groupings
    of humans. Beginning with Livingstone, Brace, and Newman is the early 1960s,
    biological anthropologists have shown that variation in human traits is
    non-concordant along racial lines, as they are products of overlapping,
    dynamic selective pressures. In 1972, Lewontin analyzed blood groups, serum
    protein, and red blood cell enzyme variants and found that only about 6% of
    total genetic variance was accounted for by race, while the majority of
    variance is accounted for by differences between individuals. Using similar
    assays, Latter obtained similar results in 1980. In 1982, Nei and
    Roychoudhury analyzed 62 protein variants and 23 blood groups, finding that
    roughly 10% of genetic variance was accounted for by race. Analyzing
    protein, blood group, and HLA variants, Ryman and coworkers obtained similar
    figures in 1983. More recently, Dean and coworkers (1994) and Barbujani and
    coworkers (1997) have used PCR techniques to analyze RFLP and microsattelite
    loci, again yielding estimates of around 10% for the amount of genetic
    variance accounted for by race. Furthermore, recent research on regional and
    racial variance in mtDNA (Excoffier and coworkers, 1992), a traditional
    marker for human racial groupings, shows a higher proportion of variance
    within than across racial categories. These studies used a variety of assays
    and analytical techniques, some of which are designed to maximize the amount
    of variance accounted for by race. In light of this, the low proportion of
    genetic variance across racial groupings strongly suggests a re-examination
    of the race concept. It no longer makes sense to adhere to arbitrary racial
    categories, or to expect that the next genetic study will provide the key to
    racial classification. Evol. Anthropol. 10:34–40, 2001. © 2001 Wiley-Liss,

    There is a longstanding debate about genetics research into intelligence.
    Some scholars question the value of focusing on genetic contributions to
    intelligence in a society where social and environmental determinants
    powerfully influence cognitive ability and educational outcomes. Others warn
    that censoring certain research questions, such as inquiries about genetic
    differences in intellectual potential, compromises academic freedom. Still
    others view interest in this subject as a corollary to a long and
    troublesome history of eugenics research. The dawn of a new era in genome
    sequencing as a commodity will sustain scientific interest in the genetics
    of intelligence for the foreseeable future, but deep-rooted challenges
    threaten the scientific merit of the research. The use of imprecise
    definitions of study populations, the difficult nature of studying the
    environment, and the potential of researcher bias are inextricably linked
    with concerns about the trustworthiness and utility of research in this
    area. Leadership by the genetics community is essential to ensure the value
    and trustworthiness of these studies.

  abstract: >-
    Engagement with scientific manuscripts is frequently facilitated by Twitter
    and other social media platforms. As such, the demographics of a paper's
    social media audience provide a wealth of information about how scholarly
    research is transmitted, consumed, and interpreted by online communities. By
    paying attention to public perceptions of their publications, scientists can
    learn whether their research is stimulating positive scholarly and public
    thought. They can also become aware of potentially negative patterns of
    interest from groups that misinterpret their work in harmful ways, either
    willfully or unintentionally, and devise strategies for altering their
    messaging to mitigate these impacts. In this study, we collected 331,696
    Twitter posts referencing 1,800 highly tweeted bioRxiv preprints and
    leveraged topic modeling to infer the characteristics of various communities
    engaging with each preprint on Twitter. We agnostically learned the
    characteristics of these audience sectors from keywords each user’s
    followers provide in their Twitter biographies. We estimate that 96% of the
    preprints analyzed are dominated by academic audiences on Twitter,
    suggesting that social media attention does not always correspond to greater
    public exposure. We further demonstrate how our audience segmentation method
    can quantify the level of interest from nonspecialist audience sectors such
    as mental health advocates, dog lovers, video game developers, vegans,
    bitcoin investors, conspiracy theorists, journalists, religious groups, and
    political constituencies. Surprisingly, we also found that 10% of the
    preprints analyzed have sizable (>5%) audience sectors that are associated
    with right-wing white nationalist communities. Although none of these
    preprints appear to intentionally espouse any right-wing extremist messages,
    cases exist in which extremist appropriation comprises more than 50% of the
    tweets referencing a given preprint. These results present unique
    opportunities for improving and contextualizing the public discourse
    surrounding scientific research.

    Jackson Jr. and Winston (2021) claim there is no taboo against research on
    race and intelligence. We argue, to the contrary, that there is a taboo
    against such research. We begin by addressing Jackson Jr. and Winston's
    arguments concerning expert surveys, as well as their criticisms of our
    published database of controversies. We then provide additional evidence of
    the taboo, and explain why it would be expected given the features of
    academic social science in Western countries. We also point out that Jackson
    Jr. and Winston's paper exemplifies the very taboo they claim does not
    exist.

  abstract: >-
    In a very short time, it is likely that we will identify many of the genetic
    variants underlying individual differences in intelligence. We should be
    prepared for the possibility that these variants are not distributed
    identically among all geographic populations, and that this explains some of
    the phenotypic differences in measured intelligence among groups. However,
    some philosophers and scientists believe that we should refrain from
    conducting research that might demonstrate the (partly) genetic origin of
    group differences in IQ. Many scholars view academic interest in this topic
    as inherently morally suspect or even racist. The majority of philosophers
    and social scientists take it for granted that all population differences in
    intelligence are due to environmental factors. The present paper argues that
    the widespread practice of ignoring or rejecting research on intelligence
    differences can have unintended negative consequences. Social policies
    predicated on environmentalist theories of group differences may fail to
    achieve their aims. Large swaths of academic work in both the humanities and
    social sciences assume the truth of environmentalism and are vulnerable to
    being undermined. We have failed to work through the moral implications of
    group differences to prepare for the possibility that they will be shown to
    exist.

    , ABSTRACT:, In the face of the increasing substitution of free speech for
    academic freedom, I argue for the distinctiveness and irreplaceability of
    the latter. Academic freedom has evolved alongside universities in order to
    support the important social purpose universities serve. Having limned this
    evolution, I compare academic freedom and free speech. This comparison
    reveals freedom of expression to be an individual freedom, and academic
    freedom to be a group-differentiated freedom with a social purpose. I argue
    that the social purpose of academic freedom behooves an inclusive approach
    to group differentiation.

  abstract: >-
    Fisher’s 1918 paper accomplished two distinct goals: unifying discrete
    Mendelian genetics with continuous biometric phenotypes and quantifying the
    variance components of variation in complex human characteristics. The
    former contributed to the foundation of modern quantitative genetics; the
    latter was adopted by social scientists interested in the pursuit of
    Galtonian nature-nurture questions about the biological and social origins
    of human behavior, especially human intelligence. This historical divergence
    has produced competing notions of the estimation of variance ratios referred
    to as heritability. Jay Lush showed that they could be applied to selective
    breeding on the farm, while the early twin geneticists used them as a
    descriptive statistic to describe the degree of genetic determination in
    complex human traits. Here we trace the early history (1918 to 1960) of the
    heritability coefficient now used by social scientists.

  abstract: >-
    This study takes off from the ethical problem that racism grounded in
    population genetics raises. It is an analysis of four standard scientific
    responses to the problem of genetically motivated racism, seen in connection
    with the Human Genome Diversity Project (HGDP): (1) Discriminatory uses of
    scientific facts and arguments are in principle ‘misuses’ of scientific data
    that the researcher cannot be further responsible for. (2) In a strict
    scientific sense, genomic facts ‘disclaim racism’, which means that an
    epistemically correct grasp of genomics should be ethically justified. (3)
    Ethical difficulties are issues to be ‘resolved’ by an ethics institution or
    committee, which will guarantee the ethical quality of the research
    scrutinized. (4) Although population genetics occasionally may lead to
    racism, its overall ‘value’ for humankind justifies its cause as a desirable
    pursuit. I argue that these typical responses to genetically motivated
    racism supervene on a principle called the ‘ethic of knowledge’, which
    implies that an epistemically correct account has intrinsic ethical value.
    This principle, and its logically related ideas concerning the ethic of
    science, effectively avoids a deeper ethical question of responsibility in
    science from being raised.

    In 2020, Pesta et al. published an article entitled “Racial and Ethnic Group
    Differences in the Heritability of Intelligence: A Systematic Review and
    Meta-Analysis” in the journal Intelligence. The authors framed their
    analysis as an examination of the Scarr-Rowe hypothesis, which holds that
    the heritability of intelligence varies as a function of socioeconomic
    status. Pesta et al. concluded that the heritability of intelligence does
    not differ across racial and ethnic groups in the United States. They
    claimed their results challenge the Scarr-Rowe hypothesis and support the
    hereditarian position that mean differences in IQ among racial and ethnic
    groups are attributable to genetic differences rather than environmental
    disparities. In this commentary, we outline severe theoretical,
    methodological, and rhetorical flaws in every step of Pesta et al.’s
    meta-analysis. The most reliable finding from Pesta et al. is consistent
    with the Scarr-Rowe hypothesis and directly contradicts a hereditarian
    understanding of group differences in intelligence. Finally, we suggest that
    Pesta et al. serves as an example of how racially motivated and poorly
    executed work can find its way into a mainstream scientific journal,
    underscoring the importance of robust peer review and rigorous editorial
    judgment in the open-science era.

    The Genos Emotional Intelligence Inventory (Genos EI) was examined
    psychometrically within a sample of Black (N=393) and White (N=393) South
    African (SA) employees. Internal consistency reliabilities were relatively
    high and similar across both Black and White samples, although there was a
    trend for lower reliabilities in the Black sample. Overall, the Black and
    White samples were associated with similar Genos EI means and standard
    deviations. Based on the differential item functioning (DIF) analyses, three
    of the 70 Genos EI items were found to be biased. However, the magnitude of
    the bias was considered negligible based on the DIF plots. Results are
    discussed in light of the small differences between Blacks and Whites on a
    measure of self-reported EI. It is suggested that some published criteria
    for evaluating practically significant DIF may be too conservative.

  abstract: >-
    Crude and dangerous ideas about the genetic heritability of intelligence,
    and a supposed biological basis for the Black/White achievement gap, are
    alive and well inside the education policy process but taking new and more
    subtle forms. Drawing on Critical Race Theory, the paper analyses recent
    hereditarian writing, in the UK and the USA, and highlight a strategy that I
    term racial inexplicitness; this allows hereditarian advocates to adopt a
    colorblind façade that presents their work as new, exciting and full of
    promise for all of society. The paper is in two parts: the first exposes the
    racism that lies hidden in the small print of the new geneism, where wildly
    misleading assertions about genetic influences on education are proclaimed
    as scientific fact while race-conscious critics are dismissed as ignorant
    ideologues. The second part of the paper sets out critical facts about the
    relevant science, including the difference between the mythic and real
    meaning of heritability; fundamental problems with the methodology of twin
    studies; the little-known history of IQ test score manipulation; and the
    continuing use of a stylistic approach that Howard Gardner characterized as
    ‘scholarly brinkmanship’.

  abstract: "The definitive refutation to the argument of The Bell Curve. When published in 1981, The Mismeasure of Man was immediately hailed as a masterwork, the ringing answer to those who would classify people, rank them according to their supposed genetic gifts and limits. And yet the idea of innate limits—of biology as destiny—dies hard, as witness the attention devoted to\_The Bell Curve, whose arguments are here so effectively anticipated and thoroughly undermined by Stephen Jay Gould. In this edition Dr. Gould has written a substantial new introduction telling how and why he wrote the book and tracing the subsequent history of the controversy on innateness right through The Bell Curve. Further, he has added five essays on questions of The Bell Curve in particular and on race, racism, and biological determinism in general. These additions strengthen the book's claim to be, as Leo J. Kamin of Princeton University has said, \"a major contribution toward deflating pseudo-biological 'explanations' of our present social woes.\""

  abstract: >-
    The science on race is clear. Common categories like “Black,” “white,” and
    “Asian” do not represent genetic differences among groups. But if race is a
    pernicious fiction according to natural science, it is all too significant
    in the day-to-day lives of racialized people across the globe. Inequities in
    health, wealth, and an array of other life outcomes cannot be explained
    without referring to “race”—but their true source is racism. What do we need
    to know about the pseudoscience of race in order to fight racism and fulfill
    human potential?In this book, two distinguished scientists tackle common
    misconceptions about race, human biology, and racism. Using an accessible
    question-and-answer format, Joseph L. Graves Jr. and Alan H. Goodman explain
    the differences between social and biological notions of race. Although
    there are many meaningful human genetic variations, they do not map onto
    socially constructed racial categories. Drawing on evidence from both
    natural and social science, Graves and Goodman dismantle the malignant myth
    of gene-based racial difference. They demonstrate that the ideology of
    racism created races and show why the inequalities ascribed to race are in
    fact caused by racism.Graves and Goodman provide persuasive and timely
    answers to key questions about race and racism for a moment when people of
    all backgrounds are striving for social justice. Racism, Not Race shows
    readers why antiracist principles are both just and backed by sound science.

  abstract: >-
    Editorial Note This book review arrived here at the beginning of this year
    with a very apologetic note from the author, Bill Hamilton, about the long
    delay in producing the review and its ‘rambling essay format’. Sadly,
    Hamilton died just a few weeks later from complications following malarial
    infection. Several tributes have been published, such as Science (2000),
    287, 2438, and we continue the tributes with a final unedited manuscript
    from the hand of this unique, colourful and idiosyncratic evolutionary
    theorist. Dysgenics: Genetic Deterioration in Modern Populations. Human
    Evolution, Behaviour, and Intelligence Series. By R. Lynn (Series Editor: S.
    Itzkoff). Westport, Connecticut and London: Praeger. 1996. Pp. 237. £47.50
    (hardback). In a sense a dominance hierarchy has only one satisfied
    individual – she or he at the top. If the hierarchy is bottom-numerous
    rather than linear, as is the case with most human hierarchies, it is all
    the more true that the vast majority of people are dissatisfied, wishing
    they were higher up, a thought which provides a basic reason why democracies
    (and especially, within democracies, such institutions as their state school
    systems) have to be unstable. We see a wobbly pyramid, and particularly
    within that pyramid we see certain side stairs all human examples have by
    which demagogues skip up a level or two so as to shout down to the restless
    base that the whole structure is somehow ‘wrong’. Under a different system,
    the demagogue shouts, ‘You could be higher too’.

    Maximizing the flow of students through the science, technology,
    engineering, and math (STEM) pipeline is important to promoting human
    capital development and reducing economic inequality1. A critical juncture
    in the STEM pipeline is the highly-cumulative sequence of secondary school
    math courses2–5. Students from disadvantaged schools are less likely to
    complete advanced math courses, but debate continues about why6,7. Here, we
    address this question using student polygenic scores, which are DNA-based
    indicators of propensity to succeed in education8. We integrated genetic and
    official school transcript data from over 3,000 European-ancestry students
    from U.S. high schools. We used polygenic scores as a molecular tracer to
    understand how the flow of students through the high school math pipeline
    differs in socioeconomically advantaged versus disadvantaged schools.
    Students with higher education polygenic scores were tracked to more
    advanced math already at the beginning of high school and persisted in math
    for more years. Molecular tracer analyses revealed that the dynamics of the
    math pipeline differed by school advantage. Compared to disadvantaged
    schools, advantaged schools tracked more students with high polygenic scores
    into advanced math classes at the start of high school, and they buffered
    students with low polygenic scores from dropping out of math. Across all
    schools, even students with exceptional polygenic scores (top 2%) were
    unlikely to take the most advanced math classes, suggesting substantial room
    for improvement in the development of potential STEM talent. These results
    link new molecular genetic discoveries to a common target of
    educational-policy reforms.

    More than a decade of exacting scientific research involving paleontological
    fragments and ancient DNA has lately produced a series of pronouncements
    about a purportedly novel population of archaic hominins dubbed “the
    Denisova.” The science involved in these matters is both technically
    stunning and, socially, at times a bit reckless. Here I discuss the
    responsibilities which scientists incur when they make inductively risky
    pronouncements about the different relative contributions by Denisovans to
    genomes of members of apparent subpopulations of current humans (i.e., the
    so-called “races”). This science is sensational: it is science which
    empirically speculates, to the public delight’s and entertainment, about
    scintillating topics such as when humans evolved, where we came from, and
    who else we were having sex with during our early hominin history. An
    initial characterization of sensational science emerges from my discussion
    of the case, as well as a diagnosis of an interactive phenomenon termed
    amplified inductive risk.

  abstract: >-
    A primary target of Indigenous psychologists and critical psychologists is
    the epistemic violence found in mainstream research. The epistemic violence
    derives from two alleged mainstream tendencies: (a) omitting
    concepts/conceptions of othered peoples and (b) interpreting observed group
    differences to be caused by inherent inferiorities of othered peoples. In
    seeking remedial research practice, some theoretical psychologists
    distinguish (a) psychological knowledge from and for the folk, which they
    advocate and (b) psychological “knowledge” about the folk, the alleged
    source of objectification of othered peoples. Though seemingly self-evident,
    this for/about prepositional divide may not be clear. First, mainstream
    epistemic violence often depends on folk notions. Second, the use in science
    of folk concepts/conceptions has advanced oppressive purposes, whereas some
    mainstream findings may serve progressive goals. I exemplify with race
    concepts, especially racialized essentialism and dehumanization, and I
    demonstrate how mainstream science sometimes reveals mechanisms of othering
    that may inform progressive social reform efforts.

  abstract: >-
    Organized Research Units (ORUs) are nondepartmental units utilized by U.S.
    research universities to support interdisciplinary research initiatives,
    among other goals. This study examined the impacts of ORUs at one large
    public research university, the University of California, Davis (UC Davis),
    using a large corpus of journal article metadata and abstracts for both
    faculty affiliated with UCD ORUs and a comparison set of other faculty.
    Using regression analysis, I find that ORUs appeared to increase the number
    of coauthors of affiliated faculty, but did not appear to directly affect
    publication or citation counts. Next, I frame interdisciplinarity in terms
    of a notion of discursive space, and use a topic model approach to situate
    researchers within this discursive space. The evidence generally indicates
    that ORUs promoted multidisciplinarity rather than interdisciplinarity. In
    the conclusion, drawing on work in philosophy of science on inter- and
    multidisciplinarity, I argue that multidisciplinarity is not necessarily
    inferior to interdisciplinarity.

    This report is the product of a major year-long initiative to acknowledge
    and reckon with past injustice, as well as progress toward justice, within
    the American Society of Human Genetics (ASHG) and the broader ﬁeld of human
    genetics. Approved by the ASHG Board of Directors and launched in 2021, the
    initiative was sparked by the social and racial reckonings in 2020. The ASHG
    Bboard of Directors asked ASHG to acknowledge and provide examples of how
    human genetics theories and knowledge ‘‘have been used to feed and justify
    racism, eugenics, and other systemic forms of injustice, and to focus
    speciﬁcally on examples of ASHG’s role in fostering or failing to rebuke
    harms and on steps the Society could take to address ﬁndings.’’ The
    initiative was undertaken with support and input from an expert panel of
    human geneticists, historians, clinician-scientists, equity scholars, and
    social scientists and included a research and environmental scan, four
    expert panel meetings, and a community dialogue as its main activities.

    Arthur R. Jensen (1923–2012) defended the idea that racial differences in
    intelligence were biologically based. He based his ideas on what he claimed
    were sound population genetics and evolutionary biology. Viewing his work
    through the lenses of those disciplines reveals that his arguments for
    biological racial differences did not meet the minimum evidentiary
    requirements needed to show that socially defined races were genetic
    populations. His evidence was from 19th-century race science and the race
    science of the Nazi regime. His reliance on such evidence supported Jensen’s
    fears that the country was in danger of collapse because of dysgenic
    breeding by those of low intelligence. Jensen’s well-known associations with
    scientific racists were not incidental to his scientific work, but central
    because he cited their work throughout his career. (PsycInfo Database Record

    <p>This paper critiques the biological race realism of Quayshawn Spencer.
    Spencer's recent embrace of “radical race pluralism” (RRP) is welcome but
    incomplete, because it needs methods that distinguish different
    communicative contexts for how American English speakers use “race” and
    related terms. I offer a pragmatic approach to identifying such contexts
    that combines pragmatic argumentation theory, rhetorical polysemy, and a
    pragmatic approach to definition. One consequence of embracing RRP is that
    Spencer's theory of “OMB race talk” is unsupportable because it collapses
    three distinct communicative contexts: genomic research, legal and
    regulatory governance, and ordinary talk. By so doing, OMB race talk blocks
    attempts to fight racism and violates ethical standards that should allow
    people the agency to define their own identities.</p>

  abstract: >-
    In this fascinating examination of the intriguing but understudied period
    following the landmark Brown v. Board of Education decision, John Jackson
    examines the scientific case aimed at dismantling the legislation.Offering a
    trenchant assessment of the so-called scientific evidence, Jackson focuses
    on the 1959 formation of the International Society for the Advancement of
    Ethnology and Eugenics (IAAEE), whose expressed function was to objectively
    investigate racial differences and publicize their findings. Notable figures
    included Carleton Putnam, Wesley Critz George, and Carleton Coon. In an
    attempt to link race, eugenics and intelligence, they launched legal
    challenges to the Brown ruling, each chronicled here, that went to trial but
    ultimately failed. The history Jackson presents speaks volumes about the
    legacy of racism, as we can see similar arguments alive and well today in
    such books as The Bell Curve and in other debates on race, science, and
    intelligence. With meticulous research and a nuanced understanding of the
    complexities of race and law, Jackson tells a disturbing tale about race in
    America.

  abstract: >-
    Psychologists' work was cited in the Supreme Court case of Brown v. Board of
    Education (1954). One criticism of the citation was that psychology could be
    used to overturn the Brown decision and return the country to segregation. A
    historical examination of such an attempt to overturn Brown in the early
    1960s on the basis of new psychological knowledge shows that psychology was
    not persuasive in the face of the civil rights movement. The failure of
    segregationists to overturn Brown with psychological experts underscores how
    psychology is ineluctably bound to the larger society. (PsycINFO Database

  abstract: >-
    In one of the twentieth century's landmark Supreme Court cases, Brown v.
    Board of Education, social scientists such as Kenneth Clark helped to
    convince the Supreme Court Justices of the debilitating psychological
    effects of racism and segregation. John P. Jackson, Jr., examines the
    well-known studies used in support of Brown, such as Clark’s famous “doll
    tests,” as well as decades of research on race which lead up to the case.
    Jackson reveals the struggles of social scientists in their effort to impact
    American law and policy on race and poverty and demonstrates that without
    these scientists, who brought their talents to bear on the most pressing
    issues of the day, we wouldn’t enjoy the legal protections against
    discrimination we may now take for granted. For anyone interested in the
    history and legacy of Brown v. Board of Education, this is an essential
    book.

    The present study uses a behavioral genetic design to investigate the
    genetic and environmental influences on variation in adolescent body mass
    index (BMI) and to determine whether the relative influences of genetic and
    environmental factors on variation in BMI are similar across racial groups
    and sexes. Data for the present study come from the National Longitudinal
    Study on Adolescent Health (Add Health), a large, nationally representative
    study of adolescent health and health-related behaviors. The Add Health
    sample contains a subset of sibling pairs that differs in levels of genetic
    relatedness, making it well suited for behavioral genetics analyses. The
    present study examines whether genetic and environmental influences on
    adolescent BMI are the same for males and females and for Black and White
    adolescents. Results indicate that genetic factors contribute substantially
    to individual differences in adolescent BMI, explaining between 45 and 85%
    of the variance in BMI. Furthermore, based on an analysis of opposite-sex
    sibling pairs, the genes that influence variation in adolescent BMI are
    similar for males and females. However, the relative importance of genetic
    and environmental influences on variation in BMI differs for males and
    females and for Blacks and Whites. Although parameter estimates could be
    constrained to be equal for Black and White males, they could not be
    constrained to be equal for Black and White females. Moreover, the
    best-fitting model for Black females was an ADE model, for White females it
    was an ACE model, and for males it was an AE model. Thus, shared
    environmental influences are significant for White female adolescents, but
    not for Black females or males. Likewise, nonadditive genetic influences are
    indicated for Black females, but not for White females or males.
    Implications of these results are discussed.

  abstract: >-
    Diverse methods have been applied to understand why science continues to be
    debated within the climate policy domain. A number of studies have presented
    the notion of the ‘echo chamber’ to model and explain information flows
    across an array of social settings, finding disproportionate connections
    among ideologically similar political communicators. This paper builds on
    these findings to provide a more formal operationalization of the components
    of echo chambers. We then empirically test their utility using survey data
    collected from the community of political elites engaged in the contentious
    issue of climate politics in the United States. Our survey period coincides
    with the most active and contentious period in the history of US climate
    policy, when legislation regulating carbon dioxide emissions had passed
    through the House of Representatives and was being considered in the Senate.
    We use exponential random graph (ERG) modelling to demonstrate that both the
    homogeneity of information (the echo) and multi-path information
    transmission (the chamber) play significant roles in policy communication.
    We demonstrate that the intersection of these components creates echo
    chambers in the climate policy network. These results lead to some important
    conclusions about climate politics, as well as the relationship between
    science communication and policymaking at the elite level more generally.

    In 1990, Thomas J. Bouchard Jr. and colleagues published the widely cited
    1990 “Minnesota Study of Twins Reared Apart” (MISTRA) *Science* IQ study. To
    arrive at the conclusion that “IQ is strongly affected by genetic factors,”
    Bouchard and colleagues omitted their control group reared-apart dizygotic
    twin (DZA) IQ score correlations. Near-full-sample correlations published
    after the study’s 2000 end point show that the reared-apart monozygotic twin
    (MZA) and DZA group IQ correlations did not differ at a statistically
    significant level, suggesting that the study failed the first step in
    determining that IQ scores are influenced by heredity. After bypassing the
    model-fitting technique they used in most non-IQ MISTRA studies, the
    researchers assumed that the MZA group IQ score correlation alone “directly
    estimates heritability.” This method was based on unsupported assumptions by
    the researchers, and they largely overlooked the confounding influence of
    cohort effects. Bouchard and colleagues then decided to count most
    environmental influences they did recognize as genetic influences. I
    conclude that the MISTRA IQ study failed to discover genetic influences on
    IQ scores and cognitive ability across the studied population, and that the
    study should be evaluated in the context of psychology’s replication
    problem.

  abstract: >-
    In what sense are associations between particular markers and complex
    behaviors made by genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and related
    techniques discoveries of, or entries into the study of, the causes of those
    behaviors? In this paper, we argue that when applied to individuals, the
    kinds of probabilistic ‘causes’ of complex traits that GWAS-style studies
    can point towards do not provide the kind of causal information that is
    useful for generating explanations; they do not, in other words, point
    towards useful explanations of why particular individuals have the traits
    that they do. We develop an analogy centered around Galton's “Quincunx”
    machine; while each pin might be associated with outcomes of a certain sort,
    in any particular trial, that pin might be entirely bypassed even if the
    ball eventually comes to rest in the box most strongly associated with that
    pin. Indeed, in any particular trial, the actual outcome of a ball hitting a
    pin might be the opposite of what is usually expected. While we might find
    particular pins associated with outcomes in the aggregate, these
    associations will not provide causally relevant information for
    understanding individual outcomes. In a similar way, the complexities of
    development likely render impossible any moves from population-level
    statistical associations between genetic markers and complex behaviors to an
    understanding of the causal processes by which individuals come to have the
    traits that they in fact have.

  abstract: "Lewis et\_al. (2011) attempted to restore the reputation of Samuel George Morton, a 19th century physician who reported on the skull sizes of different folk-races. Whereas Gould (1978) claimed that Morton's conclusions were invalid because they reflected unconscious bias, Lewis et\_al. alleged that Morton's findings were, in fact, supported, and Gould's analysis biased. We take strong exception to Lewis et\_al.’s thesis that Morton was “right.” We maintain that Gould was right to reject Morton's analysis as inappropriate and misleading, but wrong to believe that a more appropriate analysis was available. Lewis et\_al. fail to recognize that there is, given the dataset available, no appropriate way to answer any of the plausibly interesting questions about the “populations” in question (which in many cases are not populations in any biologically meaningful sense). We challenge the premise shared by both Gould and Lewis et\_al. that Morton's confused data can be used to draw any meaningful conclusions. This, we argue, reveals the importance of properly focusing on the questions asked, rather than more narrowly on the data gathered."

  abstract: >-
    Some authors defending the “hereditarian” hypothesis with respect to
    differences in average IQ scores between populations have argued that the
    sorts of environmental variation hypothesized by some researchers rejecting
    the hereditarian position should leave discoverable statistical traces,
    namely changes in the overall variance of scores or in variance–covariance
    matrices relating scores to other variables. In this paper, I argue that the
    claims regarding the discoverability of such statistical signals are broadly
    mistaken—there is no good reason to suspect that the hypothesized
    environmental causes would leave detectable traces of the sorts suggested.
    As there remains no way to gather evidence that would permit the direct
    refutation of the environmental hypotheses, and no direct evidence for the
    hereditarian position, it remains the case, I argue, that the hereditarian
    position is unsupported by current evidence.

    For centuries scientists have claimed that women are intellectually inferior
    to men and blacks are inferior to whites. Although these claims have been
    contested and corrected for centuries, they still continue to be made.
    Meanwhile, scientists have documented the harm done to women and blacks by
    the publication of such claims. Can anything be done to improve this
    situation? Freedom of research is universally recognized to be of first-rate
    importance. Yet, constraints on that freedom are also universally
    recognized. I consider three of these constraints and argue for tighter
    restrictions on race- and gender-related cognitive differences research on
    their basis.

  abstract: >-
    Topic model is a well proven tool to investigate the semantic content of
    textual corpora. Yet corpora sometimes include texts in several languages,
    making it impossible to apply language-specific computational approaches
    over their entire content. This is the problem we encountered when setting
    to analyze a philosophy of science corpus spanning over eight decades and
    including original articles in Dutch, German and French, on top of a large
    majority of articles in English. To circumvent this multilingual problem, we
    use machine-translation tools to bulk translate non-English documents into
    English. Though largely imperfect, especially syntactically, these
    translations nevertheless provide correctly translated terms and preserve
    the semantic proximity of documents with respect to one another. To assess
    the quality of this translation step, we develop a “semantic topology
    preservation test” that relies on estimating the extent to which
    document-to-document distances have been preserved during translation. We
    then conduct an LDA topic-model analysis over the entire corpus of
    translated and English original texts, and compare it to a topic-model done
    over the English original texts only. We thereby identify the specific
    contribution of the translated texts. These studies reveal a more complete
    picture of main topics that can found in the philosophy of science
    literature, especially during the early days of the discipline when numerous
    articles were published in languages other than English.

  abstract: >-
    The so-called ‘missing heritability problem’ is often characterized by
    behavior geneticists as a numerical discrepancy between alternative kinds of
    heritability. For example, while ‘traditional heritability’ derived from
    twin and family studies indicates that approximately ∼50% of variation in
    intelligence is attributable to genetics, ‘SNP heritability’ derived from
    genome-wide association studies indicates that only ∼10% of variation in
    intelligence is attributable to genetics. This 40% gap in variance accounted
    for by alternative kinds of heritability is frequently referred to as what's
    “missing.” Philosophers have picked up on this reading, suggesting that
    “dissolving” the missing heritability problem is merely a matter of closing
    the numerical gap between traditional and molecular kinds of heritability.
    We argue that this framing of the problem undervalues the severity of the
    many challenges to scientific understanding of the “heritability” of human
    behavior. On our view, resolving the numerical discrepancies between
    alternative kinds of heritability will do little to advance scientific
    explanation and understanding of behavior genetics. Thus, we propose a new
    conceptual framework of the missing heritability problem that comprises
    three independent methodological and explanatory challenges: the numerical
    gap, the prediction gap, and the mechanism gap.

    The purpose of this study is threefold. First, an estimate of state IQ is
    derived and its strengths and limitations are considered. To that end, an
    indicator of downward bias in estimating state IQ is provided. Two
    preliminary causal models are offered that predict state IQ. These models
    were found to be highly predictive of state IQ, yielding multiple R's of
    0.83 and 0.89. Second, the extent to which state IQ predicts state outcome
    variables (e.g., gross state product, health, violent crime, and government
    effectiveness) is estimated. State IQ shows positive correlations with gross
    state product, health, and government effectiveness and negative
    correlations with violent crime. These results are consistent with the
    extent to which IQ predicts outcomes at the level of the individual. Third,
    a research agenda is provided for improving estimates of state IQ,
    identifying factors that cause differences in state IQ, and delineating the
    role of IQ in predicting important variables.

    Although genetic models were in the ascendance within psychology during the
    early 20th century, the association of early behavioral genetic research
    with the eugenics movement served to discredit the field in the eyes of
    many. Twin and adoption studies throughout the latter half of the 20th
    century helped to reestablish the importance of behavioral genetic models
    and set the stage for the current focus of the field on developing and
    testing models of gene-environment interplay. Research findings on
    developmental behavioral genetic research, gene-environment interaction, and
    the use of behavioral genetic models to test causal hypotheses are used to
    highlight the contributions of contemporary behavioral genetic research to
    psychological research. It is argued that future efforts to investigate
    models of gene-environment interplay will depend heavily on the field’s
    ability to identify the specific genetic variants that contribute to
    individual differences in behavior. The anticipated yield from genome-wide
    association studies gives much reason to be optimistic about the future
    vitality of behavior genetics.

  abstract: >-
    A significant confusion has arisen out of the mass of work done on the
    history of eugenics in the last two decades. Early scholars of the subject
    treated eugenics as a marginalized or obsolete movement of the radical
    right. Subsequent research has shown that eugenic ideas were adopted in
    diverse national settings by very different groups, including — among others
    — liberals, communists and Catholics, as well as radical rightists. This
    complexity is sometimes taken to mean that eugenics has no special
    ideological associations, that it is historically and potentially a beast of
    a thousand heads. It is not. Although people of varied ideological
    commitments have been attracted to eugenics, ideologues of the radical
    right, and above all interwar fascists, have been uniquely and centrally
    involved in its development. Fascism and the radical right are also complex
    entities, but for all the heterogeneity of both eugenics and fascism, the
    special historical relationship between the two cannot be ignored. This
    relationship is exemplified in the work of the influential psychologist,
    Raymond B. Cattell. Cattell was an early supporter of German national
    socialism and his work should be understood in the context of interwar
    fascism. The new religious movement that he founded, ‘Beyondism’, is a
    neo-fascist contrivance. Cattell now promulgates ideas that he formulated
    within a demimonde of radical eugenists and neo-fascists that includes such
    associates as Revilo Oliver, Roger Pearson, Wilmot Robertson and Robert K.
    Graham. These ideas and Cattell's role in the history of eugenics deserve
    deeper analysis than they have hitherto received. Far from being of merely
    antiquarian interest, his work currently encourages the propagation of
    radical eugenist ideology. It is unconscionable for scholars to permit these
    ideas to go unchallenged, and indeed honored and emulated by a new
    generation of ideologues and academicians whose work helps to dignify the
    most destructive political ideas of the twentieth century.

    In this consensus report by a diverse group of academics who conduct and/or
    are concerned about social and behavioral genomics (SBG) research, the
    authors recount the often-ugly history of scientific attempts to understand
    the genetic contributions to human behaviors and social outcomes. They then
    describe what the current science—including genomewide association studies
    and polygenic indexes—can and cannot tell us, as well as its risks and
    potential benefits. They conclude with a discussion of responsible behavior
    in the context of SBG research. SBG research that compares individuals
    within a group according to a “sensitive” phenotype requires extra attention
    to responsible conduct and to responsible communication about the research
    and its findings. SBG research (1) on sensitive phenotypes that (2) compares
    two or more groups defined by (a) race, (b) ethnicity, or (c) genetic
    ancestry (where genetic ancestry could easily be misunderstood as race or
    ethnicity) requires a compelling justification to be conducted, funded, or
    published. All authors agree that this justification at least requires a
    convincing argument that a study's design could yield scientifically valid
    results; some authors would additionally require the study to have a
    socially favorable risk-benefit profile.

    The problem isn't that we aren't "all the same." It's that some people—and

    "social justice" look like if we accept that reality?

  abstract: >-
    Discussion of the phenomena of post-truth and fake news often implicates the
    closed epistemic networks of social media. The recent conversation has,
    however, blurred two distinct social epistemic phenomena. An epistemic
    bubble is a social epistemic structure in which other relevant voices have
    been left out, perhaps accidentally. An echo chamber is a social epistemic
    structure from which other relevant voices have been actively excluded and
    discredited. Members of epistemic bubbles lack exposure to relevant
    information and arguments. Members of echo chambers, on the other hand, have
    been brought to systematically distrust all outside sources. In epistemic
    bubbles, other voices are not heard; in echo chambers, other voices are
    actively undermined. It is crucial to keep these phenomena distinct. First,
    echo chambers can explain the post-truth phenomena in a way that epistemic
    bubbles cannot. Second, each type of structure requires a distinct
    intervention. Mere exposure to evidence can shatter an epistemic bubble, but
    may actually reinforce an echo chamber. Finally, echo chambers are much
    harder to escape. Once in their grip, an agent may act with epistemic
    virtue, but social context will pervert those actions. Escape from an echo
    chamber may require a radical rebooting of one's belief system.

    Continuing historical narratives of the early twentieth century nexus of
    conservationism, eugenics, and nativism (exemplified by Madison Grant), this
    paper traces the history of the contemporary US anti-immigration movement's
    roots in environmentalism and global population control activism, through an
    exploration of the thoughts and activities of the activist, John Tanton, who
    has been called “the most influential unknown man in America.” We explore
    the “neo-Malthusian” ideas that sparked a seminal moment for population
    control advocacy in the late 1960s and early 1970s, leading to the creation
    of Zero Population Growth (ZPG). After rising to the presidency of ZPG,
    Tanton, and ZPG spun off the Federation for American Immigration Reform.
    After leaving ZPG's leadership, Tanton created additional anti-immigration
    advocacy groups and built up connections with existing organizations such as
    the Pioneer Fund. We trace Tanton's increasingly radical conservative
    network of anti-immigration advocates, conservationists, and population
    control activists to the present day. Tanton's archived papers illustrate,
    among other things, his interactions with collaborators such as ecologist
    Garrett Hardin (author of the famous “Tragedy of the Commons”) and his
    documented interest in reviving eugenics. We contend that this history of
    Tanton's network provides key insights into understanding how there came to
    be an overlap between the ideologies and activist communities of immigration
    restrictionism, population control, conservationism and eugenics.

    The U.S. scientific community has long led the world in research on such
    areas as public health, environmental science, and issues affecting quality
    of life. These scientists have produced landmark studies on the dangers of
    DDT, tobacco smoke, acid rain, and global warming. But at the same time, a
    small yet potent subset of this community leads the world in vehement denial
    of these dangers.Merchants of Doubt tells the story of how a loose-knit
    group of high-level scientists and scientific advisers, with deep
    connections in politics and industry, ran effective campaigns to mislead the
    public and deny well-established scientific knowledge over four decades.
    Remarkably, the same individuals surface repeatedly-some of the same figures
    who have claimed that the science of global warming is "not settled" denied
    the truth of studies linking smoking to lung cancer, coal smoke to acid
    rain, and CFCs to the ozone hole. "Doubt is our product," wrote one tobacco
    executive. These "experts" supplied it. Naomi Oreskes and Erik M. Conway,
    historians of science, roll back the rug on this dark corner of the American
    scientific community, showing how ideology and corporate interests, aided by
    a too-compliant media, have skewed public understanding of some of the most
    pressing issues of our era.

    White nationalists have a genetic essentialist understanding of racial
    identity, so what happens when using genetic ancestry tests (GATs) to
    explore personal identities, they receive upsetting results they consider
    evidence of non-white or non-European ancestry? Our answer draws on
    qualitative analysis of posts on the white nationalist website Stormfront,
    interpreted by synthesizing the literatures on white nationalism and GATs
    and identity. We show that Stormfront posters exert much more energy
    repairing individuals’ bad news than using it to exclude or attack them.
    Their repair strategies combine anti-scientific, counter-knowledge attacks
    on the legitimacy of GATs and quasi-scientific reinterpretations of GATs in
    terms of white nationalist histories. However, beyond individual identity
    repair they also reinterpret the racial boundaries and hierarchies of white
    nationalism in terms of the relationships GATs make visible. White
    nationalism is not simply an identity community or political movement but
    should be understood as bricoleurs with genetic knowledge displaying aspects
    of citizen science.

    Objectives Our aim in this study was to understand how genetics ideas are
    appropriated and mobilized online toward the political projects of White
    nationalism and the alt right. Studying three different online venues, we
    investigated how genetics is used to support racial realism,
    hereditarianism, and racial hierarchy. We analyzed how these ideas are
    connected to political and metapolitical projects. In addition, we examined
    the strategies used to build authority for these interpretations. Methods We
    analyze three online venues in which genetics has been mobilized to advance
    racial realism and hereditarian explanations of racial differences. These
    were (a) the use of genetic ancestry tests in online nationalist
    discussions, (b) blogs and other venues in which the human biodiversity
    ideas are articulated, (c) activities surrounding the OpenPsych collection
    of online journals. Ethnographic and interpretive methods were applied to
    investigate scientific and political meanings of efforts to mobilize genetic
    ideas. Results We found that White nationalists use genetic ancestry tests
    to align White identity with ideas of racial purity and diversity, educating
    each other about genetics, and debating the boundaries of Whiteness. “Human
    biodiversity” has been mobilized as a movement to catalog and create
    hereditarian ideas about racial differences and to distribute them as “red
    pills” to transform online discourse. The OpenPsych journals have allowed
    amateur hereditarian psychologists to publish papers, coordinate activity,
    and legitimate their project at the academic margins. Conclusions These
    various appropriations of genetics aim to further racial realism and
    hereditarian explanations of racial social and behavioral differences.
    Beyond these substantive aims, on a “metapolitical” level, they serve to
    reframe concepts and standards for political and scientific discussion of
    race, challenge structures of academic legitimacy and expertise, and build a
    cadre of ideological foot soldiers armed with an argumentative toolkit. As
    professional anthropologists and geneticists aim to accurately communicate
    their science and its implications for understanding human differences to
    the public, they must contend with these substantive claims and
    metapolitical contexts.

  abstract: "Behavior genetics has always been a breeding ground for controversies. From the “criminal chromosome” to the “gay gene,” claims about the influence of genes like these have led to often vitriolic national debates about race, class, and inequality. Many behavior geneticists have encountered accusations of racism and have had their scientific authority and credibility questioned, ruining reputations, and threatening their access to coveted resources. \_ In\_Misbehaving Science,\_Aaron Panofsky traces the field of behavior genetics back to its origins in the 1950s, telling the story through close looks at five major controversies. In the process, Panofsky argues that persistent, ungovernable controversy in behavior genetics is due to the broken hierarchies within the field. All authority and scientific norms are questioned, while the absence of unanimously accepted methods and theories leaves a foundationless field, where disorder is ongoing. Critics charge behavior geneticists with political motivations; champions say they merely follow the data where they lead. But Panofsky shows how pragmatic coping with repeated controversies drives their scientific actions. Ironically, behavior geneticists’ struggles for scientific authority and efforts to deal with the threats to their legitimacy and autonomy have made controversy inevitable—and in some ways essential—to the study of behavior genetics."

    Discussions about the biological bases (or lack thereof) of the concept of
    race in the human species seem to be never ending. One of the latest rounds
    is represented by a paper by Neven Sesardic, which attempts to build a
    strong scientific case for the existence of human races, based on genetic,
    morphometric and behavioral characteristics, as well as on a thorough
    critique of opposing positions. In this paper I show that Sesardic’s
    critique falls far short of the goal, and that his positive case is
    exceedingly thin. I do this through a combination of analysis of the actual
    scientific findings invoked by Sesardic and of some philosophical unpacking
    of his conceptual analysis, drawing on a dual professional background as an
    evolutionary biologist and a philosopher of science.

    A century after the first twin and adoption studies of behavior in the
    1920s, this review looks back on the journey and celebrates milestones in
    behavioral genetic research. After a whistle-stop tour of early quantitative
    genetic research and the parallel journey of molecular genetics, the
    travelogue focuses on the last fifty years. Just as quantitative genetic
    discoveries were beginning to slow down in the 1990s, molecular genetics
    made it possible to assess DNA variation directly. From a rocky start with
    candidate gene association research, by 2005 the technological advance of
    DNA microarrays enabled genome-wide association studies, which have
    successfully identified some of the DNA variants that contribute to the
    ubiquitous heritability of behavioral traits. The ability to aggregate the
    effects of thousands of DNA variants in polygenic scores has created a DNA
    revolution in the behavioral sciences by making it possible to use DNA to
    predict individual differences in behavior from early in life.

  abstract: "One of John Loehlin’s many contributions to the field of behavioral genetics involves gene-environment (GE) correlation. The empirical base for GE correlation was research showing that environmental measures are nearly as heritable as behavioral measures and that genetic factors mediate correlations between environment and behavior. Attempts to identify genes responsible for these phenomena will come up against the ‘missing heritability’ problem that plagues DNA research on complex traits throughout the life sciences. However, DNA can also be used for quantitative genetic analyses of unrelated individuals (Genome-wide\_Complex Trait Analysis, GCTA) to investigate genetic influence on environmental measures and their behavioral correlates. A novel feature of GCTA is that it enables genetic analysis of family-level environments (e.g., parental socioeconomic status) and school-level environments (e.g., teaching quality) that cannot be investigated using within-family designs such as the twin method. An important implication of GE correlation is its shift from a passive model of the environment imposed on individuals to an active model in which individuals actively create their own experiences in part on the basis of their genetic propensities."

    In the past, work on racial and ethnic variation in brain and behavior was
    marginalized within genetics. Against the backdrop of genetics’ eugenic
    legacy, wide consensus held such research to be both ethically problematic
    and methodologically controversial. But today it is finding new
    opportunistic venues in a global, transdisciplinary, data-rich postgenomic
    research environment in which such a consensus is increasingly strained. The
    postgenomic sciences display worrisome deficits in their ability to govern
    and negotiate standards for making postgenomic claims in the
    transdisciplinary space between human population variation research, studies
    of intelligence, neuroscience, and evolutionary biology. Today some
    researchers are pursuing the genomics of intelligence on a newly grand
    scale. They are sequencing large numbers of whole genomes of people
    considered highly intelligent (by varying empirical and social measures) in
    the hope of finding gene variants predictive of intelligence. Troubling and
    at times outlandish futurist claims accompany this research. Scientists
    involved in this research have openly discussed the possibility of marketing
    prenatal tests for intelligence, of genetic engineering or selective embryo
    implantation to increase the likelihood of a high-IQ child, and of
    genotyping children to guide their education. In this permissive and
    contested environment, what would trustworthy research on the genomics of
    high intelligence look like?

  abstract: >-
    The history of research on the genetics of intelligence is fraught with
    social bias. During the eugenics era, the hereditary theory of intelligence
    justified policies that encouraged the proliferation of favored races and
    coercively stemmed procreation by disfavored ones. In the 1970s, Berkeley
    psychologist Arthur Jensen argued that black students’ innate cognitive
    inferiority limited the efficacy of federal education programs. The 1994
    controversial bestseller The Bell Curve, by Richard J. Herrnstein and
    Charles Murray, rehashed the claim that race and class disparities stem from
    immutable differences in inherited intelligence, which could not be
    eliminated through social interventions. Today most scientists studying the
    genetics of intelligence distance themselves from this history of social
    bias by arguing that their research need not investigate intellectual
    differences between social groups. Rather, they argue, examining the
    heritability of intelligence can be socially neutral and may even help to
    reduce social inequities. I argue, however, that research on the genetics of
    intelligence cannot be socially neutral. Even if we divorce the heritability
    of intelligence from a eugenicist mission, measuring intelligence remains
    useful only as a gage of individuals’ appropriate positions in society.
    Research into the genetics of intelligence ultimately helps to determine
    individuals’ inherited capacity for particular social positions, even when
    researchers aim to modify the effects of inheritance.

    Psychologists developed Multiple Factor Analysis to decompose multivariate
    data into a small number of interpretable factors without any a priori
    knowledge about those factors. In this form of factor analysis, the Varimax
    "factor rotation" is a key step to make the factors interpretable. Charles
    Spearman and many others objected to factor rotations because the factors
    seem to be rotationally invariant. These objections are still reported in
    all contemporary multivariate statistics textbooks. This is an engima
    because this vintage form of factor analysis has survived and is widely
    popular because, empirically, the factor rotation often makes the factors
    easier to interpret. We argue that the rotation makes the factors easier to
    interpret because, in fact, the Varimax factor rotation performs statistical
    inference. We show that Principal Components Analysis (PCA) with the Varimax
    rotation provides a unified spectral estimation strategy for a broad class
    of modern factor models, including the Stochastic Blockmodel and a natural
    variation of Latent Dirichlet Allocation (i.e., "topic modeling"). In
    addition, we show that Thurstone's widely employed sparsity diagnostics
    implicitly assess a key "leptokurtic" condition that makes the rotation
    statistically identifiable in these models. Taken together, this shows that
    the know-how of Vintage Factor Analysis performs statistical inference,
    reversing nearly a century of statistical thinking on the topic. With a
    sparse eigensolver, PCA with Varimax is both fast and stable. Combined with
    Thurstone's straightforward diagnostics, this vintage approach is suitable
    for a wide array of modern applications.

  abstract: >-
    In 1972, R.C. Lewontin concluded that it follows from the fact that the
    large majority of human genetic variation (≈ 85%) is among individuals
    within local populations that racial taxonomy is unjustified. Three decades
    later, Edwards demonstrated that while the accuracy with which individuals
    may be assigned to groups is poor for a single locus, consideration of
    multi-locus data allows for highly accurate assignments. Edwards concluded
    that Lewontin's dismissal of racial taxonomy was unwarranted. Edwards
    misidentified the aim of Lewontin's critique, which was directed at the
    utility of racial classification and not at assigning individuals to groups
    using genetic data. Moreover, Edwards conflated distinct kinds of
    correlation when sketching out his argument. If we follow Edwards’ argument
    to its natural terminus, it becomes clear that it is consideration of all of
    the correlation structure among local groups in human genetic data that
    renders racial taxonomy scientifically useless. Lewontin considers the
    correlation structure relevant to his analysis of racial taxonomy and does
    not make his eponymous misstep. Rather, critics of Lewontin who use racial
    taxonomies in their work are the primary offenders when it comes to
    committing Lewontin's fallacy.

  abstract: >-
    We studied human population structure using genotypes at 377 autosomal
    microsatellite loci in 1056 individuals from 52 populations.
    Within-population differences among individuals account for 93 to 95% of
    genetic variation; differences among major groups constitute only 3 to 5%.
    Nevertheless, without using prior information about the origins of
    individuals, we identified six main genetic clusters, five of which
    correspond to major geographic regions, and subclusters that often
    correspond to individual populations. General agreement of genetic and
    predefined populations suggests that self-reported ancestry can facilitate
    assessments of epidemiological risks but does not obviate the need to use
    genetic information in genetic association studies.

  abstract: >-
    An astute and timely examination of the re-emergence of scientific research
    into racial differences  Superior tells the disturbing story of the
    persistent thread of belief in biological racial differences in the world of
    science.  After the horrors of the Nazi regime in WWII, the mainstream
    scientific world turned its back on eugenics and the study of racial
    difference. But a worldwide network of unrepentant eugenicists quietly
    founded journals and funded research, providing the kind of shoddy studies
    that were ultimately cited in Richard Hernstein's and Charles Murray's 1994
    title, The Bell Curve, which purported to show differences in intelligence
    among races.  If the vast majority of scientists and scholars disavowed
    these ideas, and considered race a social construct, it was still an idea
    that managed to somehow make its way into the research into the human genome
    that began in earnest in the mid-1990s and continues today. Dissecting the
    statements and work of contemporary scientists studying human biodiversity,
    most of whom claim to be just following the data, Saini shows us how, again
    and again, science is retrofitted to accommodate race. Even as our
    understanding of highly complex traits like intelligence, and the
    complicated effect of environmental influences on human beings, from the
    molecular level on up, grows, the hope of finding simple genetic differences
    between "races"--to explain differing rates of disease, to explain poverty
    or test scores or to justify cultural assumptions--stubbornly persists.  At
    a time when racialized nationalisms are a resurgent threat throughout the
    world, Superior is a powerful reminder that biologically, we are all far
    more alike than different.

  abstract: >-
    This essay explores the speech act of dogwhistling (sometimes referred to as
    ‘using coded language’). Dogwhistles may be overt or covert, and within each
    of these categories may be intentional or unintentional. Dogwhistles are a
    powerful form of political speech, allowing people to be manipulated in ways
    they would resist if the manipulation was carried outmore openly—often
    drawing on racist attitudes that are consciously rejected. If philosophers
    focus only on content expressed or otherwise consciously conveyed they may
    miss what is most powerful and pernicious in the speech of political
    culture. This essay is a call to start paying attention to these more covert
    speech acts, and a first attempt at beginning to theorize them. It argues
    that dogwhistles present a complex and interesting case for the philosopher
    of language, and explores their implications for democratic politics.

    Biologist and botanist Reginald Gates is mainly remembered as a staunch
    scientific conservative, a defender of racial theory and fierce opponent of
    racial mixing. In post-war Britain and America, Gates's racial views made
    him something of a pariah. This article explores Gates's post-war career as
    a micro-historical analysis of racial science and society after the Second
    World War. It examines the relationship between scientific racists and
    segregationists in the US, especially concerning the Brown ruling and the
    establishment of the Mankind Quarterly journal, arguing that science in this
    period was subsumed into politics as protagonists on both sides of the
    segregation debate used science to justify ideological positions.

  abstract: >-
    Scientists are frequently called upon to “democratize” science, by bringing
    the public into scientific research. One appealing point for public
    involvement concerns the nonepistemic values involved in science. Suppose,
    though, a scientist invites the public to participate in making such
    value-laden determinations but finds that the public holds values the
    scientist considers morally unacceptable. Does the argument for
    democratizing science commit the scientist to accepting the public’s
    objectionable values, or may she veto them? I argue that there are a limited
    set of cases in which scientists can, consistently with a commitment to
    democratized science, set aside the public’s judgments.

  abstract: >-
    An instant bestseller, The Bell Curve (1994) by Richard J. Herrnstein and
    Charles Murray deployed psychological race science against enduring demands
    in the United States for social justice and equality of economic outcomes.
    Using new archival evidence, this article situates the book in a
    long-standing transatlantic exchange about race science that runs through
    the world of conservative philanthropy and free-market think tanks, with a
    special role played by the psychologist Richard Lynn. It also illuminates a
    broader shift in the history of free-market conservatism in the 1990s away
    from behaviorism, rational choice theory, and cost-benefit analysis and
    toward the idioms of differential psychology and intelligence. What I call
    the "new fusionism" defends libertarian policies through arguments borrowed
    from cognitive, behavioral, and evolutionary psychology and, in some cases,
    genetics and genomics, sociobiology, and biological anthropology. Assertions
    about the unequal mind became a renewed basis for attacks on
    political-economic equality.

  abstract: >-
    From the very beginning, studies of the nature and nurture of intelligence
    have been closely associated with an interest in intervening, and those
    interventions have been surrounded by controversy. The nature of those
    controversies has not always been the same, however. Since the
    mid-nineteenth century, when Francis Galton imagined a science that would
    assess the extent to which a trait like “genius” was due to nature or due to
    nurture, science and technology have changed dramatically, and so have the
    interventions that have been envisioned in light of those developments. A
    scientist today can search for particular stretches of DNA and assess
    whether differences in those stretches are associated with differences in a
    human trait of interest; a genetic counselor today can genetically test an
    individual (be it an embryo, fetus, newborn, child, or adult) and provide
    information about what that genetic result means, allowing for interventions
    that can range from terminating a pregnancy to prescribing chemotherapy. So
    when one asks a question like, “Why is studying the genetics of intelligence
    controversial?,” it is important to realize up front that the answer will
    be, “It can be controversial for a variety of different reasons, and those
    reasons have evolved over time.” The purpose of this essay is to provide a
    survey of the controversies that surround genetic studies of intelligence.
    With the survey in place, I will then draw out several lessons both for
    scientists who study the genetics of intelligence as well as for science
    studies scholars (bioethicists, philosophers, historians, sociologists) who
    reflect and comment on the controversies surrounding that research.

    The “Flynn effect” refers to the observed rise in IQ scores over time,
    resulting in norms obsolescence. Although the Flynn effect is widely
    accepted, most approaches to estimating it have relied upon “scorecard”
    approaches that make estimates of its magnitude and error of measurement
    controversial and prevent determination of factors that moderate the Flynn
    effect across different IQ tests. We conducted a meta-analysis to determine
    the magnitude of the Flynn effect with a higher degree of precision, to
    determine the error of measurement, and to assess the impact of several
    moderator variables on the mean effect size. Across 285 studies (N = 14,031)
    since 1951 with administrations of two intelligence tests with different
    normative bases, the meta-analytic mean was 2.31, 95% CI [1.99, 2.64],
    standard score points per decade. The mean effect size for 53 comparisons (N
    = 3,951) (excluding three atypical studies that inflate the estimates)
    involving modern (since 1972) Stanford-Binet and Wechsler IQ tests (2.93,
    95% CI [2.3, 3.5], IQ points per decade) was comparable to previous
    estimates of about 3 points per decade, but not consistent with the
    hypothesis that the Flynn effect is diminishing. For modern tests, study
    sample (larger increases for validation research samples vs. test
    standardization samples) and order of administration explained unique
    variance in the Flynn effect, but age and ability level were not significant
    moderators. These results supported previous estimates of the Flynn effect
    and its robustness across different age groups, measures, samples, and
    levels of performance.

    Founded by Wickliffe Preston Draper in 1937, the Pioneer Fund has long been
    the major source of support for researchers who conclude that blacks are
    genetically less intelligent than whites. The fund’s president, New York
    attorney Harry F. Weyher, has steadfastly maintained that his only interest
    has been to promote the advancement of scientific knowledge. Archival
    records indicate, however, that Weyher, Draper and others connected with the
    fund have a lengthy history of surreptitiously opposing the extension of
    constitutional guarantees to black citizens.

    Apache Parquet is an efficient, structured, column-oriented (also called
    columnar storage), compressed, binary file format. Parquet supports several
    compression codecs, including Snappy, GZIP, deflate, and BZIP2. Snappy is
    the default. Structured file formats such as RCFile, Avro, SequenceFile, and
    Parquet offer better performance with compression support, which reduces the
    size of the data on the disk and consequently the I/O and CPU resources
    required to deserialize data.

  abstract: "Have Jews insinuated themselves into positions of power and influence in politics and culture because they are innately gifted with higher IQs, or is it also because they are ethnocentric and hypocritical networkers good at using non-Jews in their self-serving mission of “transforming America contrary to white interests”? Race science and/or conspiracy theory? This—pardon the editorializing—outrageous question is currently under discussion in the pages of the academic philosophy journal Philosophia. Welcome to 2022. January 1st saw the online publication of “The ‘Default Hypothesis’ Fails to Explain Jewish Influence” by Kevin MacDonald, who is described on Wikipedia as an “anti-Semitic conspiracy theorist, white supremacist, and retired professor of evolutionary psychology.” MacDonald’s 32-page article is a response to a piece by Nathan Cofnas, “The Anti-Jewish Narrative,” that Philosophia\_published last February, and which is one of a series of pieces in which Cofnas critiques McDonald. Both MacDonald and Cofnas are preoccupied with the question: “Did Jews create liberal multiculturalism to advance their ethnic interests?” (Cofnas, p.1332). Cofnas’s take on that issue is ultimately based on his claim that “Jews are overrepresented in all intellectual movements and activities that are not overtly anti-Semitic primarily because they have high mean IQs” (Cofnas, p.1331). This is part of his view that there is “legitimate science on race differences” (Cofnas, p. 1332) in regard to intelligence (previously). Cofnas characterizes MacDonald as claiming that “intelligent, ethnocentric Jews created liberal intellectual and political movements to promote Jewish interests at the expense of gentiles” (Cofnas, pp. 1330-31). MacDonald posits ethnocentric “ethnic networking” (MacDonald, p.2), “Jewish hypocrisy” (p.9), “Jewish activism” (throughout), and efforts to “recruit gentiles as ‘window dressing’ to conceal the extent of Jewish dominance” (p.3) in leftwing organizations, among other things, as elements of the Jewish conspiracy. MacDonald also takes up the question of whether Jews should be welcomed by white supremacists. Here is his answer, which I reproduce as a screenshot for those who might otherwise be incredulous that an academic journal published these words: Did I mention that\_Philosophia‘s subtitle is “Philosophical Quarterly of Israel“? One might wonder to what extent Cofnas and MacDonald consider the publication of their articles in an Israel-based journal evidence against the presumptions of their debate. Philosophia\_is edited by Asa Kasher (Tel Aviv)..."

  abstract: >-
    The evaluative, pejorative category ‘pseudoscientific’ has, thanks to its
    questionable analytical value, been far less often applied to racial thought
    than in previous decades. Yet this tendency comes at the cost of obscuring
    one of the most interesting questions about racial ideas – how far were they
    not only conceivable, but respectable? This article makes the case for using
    the category of the pseudoscientific to describe early modern racial ideas,
    despite its apparent anachronism, because few labels can better capture the
    intellectual foul play at work. After exploring the development and use of
    ‘pseudoscience’ for a more recent era, this article discusses the evidence
    base for racial ideas – especially its close relation to movement and
    communication – before analysing a case study (the debate on polygenesis
    after 1770) replete with the features of ‘pseudoscience’.

  abstract: >-
    The emergence of restorative justice as an alternative model to Western,
    court-based criminal justice may have important implications for the
    psychology of justice. It is proposed that two different notions of justice
    affect responses to rule-breaking: restorative and retributive justice.
    Retributive justice essentially refers to the repair of justice through
    unilateral imposition of punishment, whereas restorative justice means the
    repair of justice through reaffirming a shared value-consensus in a
    bilateral process. Among the symbolic implications of transgressions,
    concerns about status and power are primarily related to retributive justice
    and concerns about shared values are primarily related to restorative
    justice. At the core of these processes, however, lies the parties’
    construal of their identity relation, specifically whether or not
    respondents perceive to share an identity with the offender. The specific
    case of intergroup transgressions is discussed, as are implications for
    future research on restoring a sense of justice after rule-breaking.

    How did IQ become an important means of naturalizing economic and racial
    inequality and supporting neoliberal visions of a fully privatized, free
    market society? I show how post-WWII neoliberals and libertarians could
    employ ideas of “innate intelligence” to promote the reduction of government
    funding of social programs. For extreme libertarian economist Murray
    Rothbard, inequality among individuals and ethnicities was self-evident from
    human history and the a priori examination of the “natural order,” but IQ
    data could also be employed in the fight against “egalitarianism.” Any
    attempt to interfere in this “natural order,” such as civil rights
    legislation, was viewed as inherently evil. For libertarian Charles Murray
    and more mainstream neoliberals such as Milton Friedman, empirical research
    on intelligence was an effective means of influencing public perception and
    policy on welfare, affirmative action, and immigration. I discuss recent
    work on “national intelligence” in relation to neoliberal projects and
    enduring fears regarding reproduction and family.

  abstract: >-
    The use of psychological concepts and data to promote ideas of an enduring
    racial hierarchy dates from the late 1800s and has continued to the present.
    The history of scientific racism in psychology is intertwined with broader
    debates, anxieties, and political issues in American society. With the rise
    of intelligence testing, joined with ideas of eugenic progress and dysgenic
    reproduction, psychological concepts and data came to play an important role
    in naturalizing racial inequality. Although racial comparisons were not the
    primary concern of most early mental testing, results were employed to
    justify beliefs regarding Black “educability” and the dangers of Southern
    and Eastern European immigration. Mainstream American psychology became
    increasingly liberal and anti-racist in the late 1930s and after World War
    II. However, scientific racism did not disappear and underwent renewal
    during the civil rights era and again during the 1970s and 1990s,
    Intelligence test scores were a primary weapon in attempts to preserve
    segregated schools and later to justify economic inequality. In the case of
    Henry Garrett, Arthur Jensen, and Philippe Rushton, their work included
    active, public promotion of their ideas of enduring racial differences, and
    involvement with publications and groups under control of racial extremists
    and neo-Nazis. Despite 100 years of strong critiques of scientific racism, a
    small but active group of psychologists helped revive vicious 19th-century
    claims regarding Black intelligence, brain size, morality, criminality, and
    sexuality, presented as detached scientific facts. These new claims were
    used in popular campaigns that aimed to eliminate government programs,
    promote racial separation, and increase immigration restriction. This
    troubling history raises important ethical questions for the discipline.

  abstract: >-
    I describe how the problem of “value neutrality” remained a central issue
    for SPSSI from the founding of the organization to the 1960s, as SPSSI
    leaders worked to maintain legitimacy in both scientific and public spheres.
    In 1930s psychology, notions of objectivity and political neutrality were
    intertwined in ways that produced substantial debate over SPSSI's aims.
    Under pressures from anticommunism and changes in public and private funding
    for research, the problem of neutrality intensified by the 1950s. In this
    new climate, the need to demonstrate value neutrality was a powerful
    constraint on the ability of SPSSI to respond to resurgent scientized racism
    after the Supreme Court Brown decision.

  abstract: >-
    Mainstream research on racial essentialization may be valuable in the fight
    against racism, as Held (2020) suggested. I argue that the production of
    scientific racism in the literature of psychology is unlikely to be affected
    by such research. Assertions by psychologists of Black people’s average
    inferiority in brain size, intelligence, and morality have persisted for
    over 100 years despite repeated, careful critiques. Recent presentations of
    these old and discredited claims have sidestepped the fundamental criticism
    that they rest on essentialized racial categories. The survival of
    scientific racism in mainstream psychology journals should be understood as
    a community project with its own Weltanschauung of “racial progress.”

    This paper provides a restatement and defense of the data/ phenomena
    distinction introduced by Jim Bogen and me several decades ago (e.g., Bogen
    and Woodward, The Philosophical Review, 303–352, 1988). Additional
    motivation for the distinction is introduced, ideas surrounding the
    distinction are clarified, and an attempt is made to respond to several
    criticisms.

  abstract: >-
    Intelligence quotient (IQ) is a common measure of intelligence that
    associates with many important life outcomes. Research over several decades
    has indicated that the average IQ test score among Black Americans is lower
    than the average IQ test score among White Americans, but in weighted
    results from a national nonprobability survey, only about 41% of US adults
    indicated awareness of this IQ gap. Results from a follow-up convenience
    survey indicated that, in the aggregate, White participants’ rating of White
    Americans’ average IQ and average intelligence is higher than Blacks
    Americans’ average IQ test score and average intelligence and was not driven
    by White participants’ belief in a universal White intellectual superiority.
    These and other results could have implications regarding the US public’s
    perceptions about the reasons for Black/White inequality and implications
    for the use of intelligence stereotype scales as measures of racial
    prejudice.
