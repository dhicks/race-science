<!--
## Some definitions

scientific racism
 ~ (purportedly) justifying racial inequality and colonialism by appealing to the epistemic authority of science
 
race science - wide sense
 ~ scientific research that is amenable to scientific racism

race science - narrow sense
 ~ scientific research that itself engages in scientific racism

- Ex: genotype clustering studies [@RosenbergGeneticStructureHuman2002] or polygenic scores for educational attainment [@HardenGeneticAssociationsMathematics2019] 
can be wide-sense race science without being narrow-sense race science [@CarlsonQuantifyingContextualizingImpact2020; WillsAreClustersRaces2017]

- This talk will focus on narrow-sense race science

> Ultimately, anti-'racial' science played a defining role in the Supreme Court’s dismissal of the 'separate-but-equal' principle in education .... [@SchafferScientificRacismAgain2007 261; see also @JacksonScienceSegregationRace2005]


## *MQ* was founded as race science

> [[E]veryone agrees that races or ethnic groups exist and that they are in fact the raw material by means of which human evolution has taken place]{.red} ....

> [A scientific approach to racial questions, free from sentiment, propaganda or bias]{.blue}, may lead to a more reasonable attitude to the problems which agitate considerable sections of mankind. This need for a calmer approach to problems of race on the part of [civilised peoples as well as more primitive tribes]{.red} makes it desirable that a journal should exist in which the problems of racial origin and racial relationships can be quietly discussed, [without rancour or bigotry and with the primary aim of elucidating facts]{.blue}. (Gates, *MQ* 1:1 [1960], 11)






# Race science agnotology

## The Tobacco Strategy {.smallish}

Five core strategies used by industry to manufacture doubt and create the appearance of legitimate scientific controversy [after @FernandezPintoKnowBetterNot2017, esp. 59]

1. Emphasize scientific uncertainty
2. Support friendly research
3. Recruit distinguished scientists as spokesperson
4. [Construct echo chambers]{.red}
	- "creation and distribution of non-peer-reviewed journals and pamphlets"
	- "funding and organizing of symposiums" 
	- ["In this way, the tobacco industry circumvented peer review standards in publication"]{.red}
5. Attack unfavorable research 

\

[Did Pioneer and *Mankind Quarterly* function in this way for race science?]{.red}

# Conclusion

- Race & intelligence research did not appear to originate in MQ and spread to other journals
- Instead, Intelligence and PID were the primary "echo chambers" used to legitimize this psychological form of race science
- "The agnotology is coming from inside the house"

## Gould's critique of factor analysis {visibility="uncounted"}

> As a tool for simplification, [PCA/factor analysis] has proved its great value in many disciplines. But many factorists have gone beyond simplification, and tried to define factors as causal entities. This error of reification has plagued the technique since its inception .... [F]actors, by themselves, are neither things nor causes; they are mathematical abstractions. [@GouldMismeasureManRevised1996 284-5]

- `tmfast` uses methods from PCA and factor analysis [@RoheVintageFactorAnalysis2020]
	- (partial) PCA
	- varimax rotation

- Need to avoid hasty reification of topics


## Topic modeling as phenomena construction {visibility="uncounted"}

Topics as phenomena [@BogenSavingPhenomena1988; @WoodwardDataPhenomenaRestatement2009]

- simplified patterns extracted from word occurrence data
- may or may not be stable:\
  will we see the same topics in a different corpus? [@MalaterreEarlyDaysContemporary2022]
- constructed with minimal role for substantive theory
- **explananda, not explanans**
	
These words tend to be used together; **but why?**\
These test items tend to be answered in the same way; **but why?**
