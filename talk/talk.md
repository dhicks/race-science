# Race science

## Some definitions

scientific racism
 ~ (purportedly) justifying racial inequality and colonialism by appealing to the epistemic authority of science
 
race science - wide sense
 ~ scientific research that is amenable to scientific racism

race science - narrow sense
 ~ scientific research that itself engages in scientific racism

- Ex: genotype clustering studies [@RosenbergGeneticStructureHuman2002] or polygenic scores for educational attainment [@HardenGeneticAssociationsMathematics2019] 
can be wide-sense race science without being narrow-sense race science [@CarlsonQuantifyingContextualizingImpact2020; WillsAreClustersRaces2017]

- This talk will focus on narrow-sense race science

# Race science as agnotology and echo chamber

## The Tobacco Strategy

Five core strategies used by industry to manufacture doubt and create the appearance of legitimate scientific controversy [after @FernandezPintoKnowBetterNot2017, esp. 59]

1. Emphasize scientific uncertainty
2. Support friendly research
3. Recruit distinguished scientists as spokesperson
4. [Construct echo chambers]{.red}
	- "creation and distribution of non-peer-reviewed journals and pamphlets"
	- "funding and organizing of symposiums" 
	- ["In this way, the tobacco industry circumvented peer review standards in publication"]{.red}
5. Attack unfavorable research

## Topic modeling

![Diachronic evolution of topic categories in *Philosophy of Science*, 1934–2015. @MalaterreWhatThisThing2019 fig. 2.](img/MalaterreWhatThisThing2019.jpeg){width="80%"}

- Statistical method for clustering documents and words simultaneously
- Documents are composed of topics; topics are composed of words
- Custom R package [`tmfast`](https://github.com/dhicks/tmfast)


## Gould's critique of factor analysis

> As a tool for simplification, [PCA/factor analysis] has proved its great value in many disciplines. But many factorists have gone beyond simplification, and tried to define factors as causal entities. This error of reification has plagued the technique since its inception .... [F]actors, by themselves, are neither things nor causes; they are mathematical abstractions. [@GouldMismeasureManRevised1996 284-5]

- `tmfast` uses methods from PCA and factor analysis [@RoheVintageFactorAnalysis2020]
	- (partial) PCA
	- varimax rotation

- Need to avoid hasty reification of topics


## Topic modeling as phenomena construction

Topics as phenomena [@BogenSavingPhenomena1988; @WoodwardDataPhenomenaRestatement2009]

- simplified patterns extracted from word occurrence data
- may or may not be stable:\
  will we see the same topics in a different corpus? [@MalaterreEarlyDaysContemporary2022]
- constructed with minimal role for substantive theory
- **explananda, not explanans**
	
These words tend to be used together; **but why?**\
These test items tend to be answered in the same way; **but why?**
